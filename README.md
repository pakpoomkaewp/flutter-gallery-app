# flutter-gallery-app
This project is a hands-on exercise to build a gallery app in Flutter, focusing on implementing a range of essential features. It will cover capturing images with the camera, selecting single or multiple images, and basic image management like deleting, saving, and uploading. A key learning objective is to integrate the native "Share to" functionality, allowing the app to receive images shared from other applications.

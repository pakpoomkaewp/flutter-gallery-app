## Overview

Android's storage access model has undergone significant changes over the years. Applications targeting different Android versions need to handle storage access differently. Our Flutter Gallery App implements a unified approach that works across Android versions while following best practices for each API level.

## Android Version-Specific Approaches

### Android 5.0-9.0 (API 21-28)

- **Permission Model**: Traditional permission model where requesting `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` grants broad access to external storage
- **Runtime Permissions**: Starting from Android 6.0 (API 23), runtime permissions are required
- **File Access**: Direct file system access to most locations with appropriate permissions

### Android 10 (API 29)

- **Introduction of Scoped Storage**: Restricted access to file system
- **Legacy Storage Option**: Can temporarily opt out with `requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"`
- **Media Files**: Can use MediaStore API for media-related operations
- **App-Specific Storage**: No permissions needed for app's own directories

### Android 11+ (API 30+)

- **Enforced Scoped Storage**: Legacy storage option no longer available
- **MediaStore API**: Required for accessing and modifying media files
- **Storage Access Framework (SAF)**: Required for user-selected directories
- **Permissions**: More specific permissions like `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` for file manager apps
- **App-Specific Storage**: Continues to be available without permissions

## Implementation Strategy

Our strategy for handling storage across all Android versions includes:

1. **Declaring appropriate permissions** in the manifest
2. **Checking and requesting runtime permissions** when needed
3. **Implementing version-specific logic** in a dedicated storage service
4. **Providing fallback mechanisms** for when preferred methods aren't available

## Required Configuration

### AndroidManifest.xml

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <!-- Storage permission - required for Android 5.0-9.0 -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    
    <application
        android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
        ...>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

### build.gradle.kts

```kotlin
defaultConfig {
    // Our app supports from Android 5.0 (API 21) upward
    minSdk = 21
    ...
}
```

### Required Flutter Packages

- **permission_handler**: For managing runtime permissions
- **path_provider**: For accessing system directories
- **image_picker**: For capturing or selecting images (if needed)

## Code Implementation

Our implementation consists of the following components:

### 1. Storage Service

We've created a `StorageService` class that abstracts away the version-specific details:

```dart
class StorageService {
  // Check if the app has storage permission
  Future<bool> requestStoragePermission() async { ... }

  // Save a file to app-specific directory (works on all Android versions)
  Future<String> saveFileToAppDirectory(File file, String fileName) async { ... }

  // Save a file to public directory (needs different handling across Android versions)
  Future<String?> saveFileToPublicDirectory(File file, String fileName, {required String folderName}) async { ... }

  // Helper methods for Android version detection
  Future<bool> _isAndroid10OrAbove() async { ... }
  Future<int> _getAndroidSdkVersion() async { ... }
}
```

#### Key Implementation Details:

- **App-Specific Storage**: Uses `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` or `getExternalStorageDirectory()` which works across all Android versions without special permissions
- **Public Storage**: 
  - For Android 5.0-9.0: Direct file system access with permissions
  - For Android 10+: Uses app-specific external storage as a fallback, or implements MediaStore API

### 2. Permission Handling

Runtime permissions are requested at the appropriate time:

```dart
Future<bool> requestStoragePermission() async {
  if (Platform.isAndroid) {
    final status = await Permission.storage.status;
    if (status != PermissionStatus.granted) {
      final result = await Permission.storage.request();
      return result == PermissionStatus.granted;
    }
    return true;
  }
  return true; // iOS or other platforms
}
```

### 3. Version Detection

To apply the correct strategy based on Android version:

```dart
Future<bool> _isAndroid10OrAbove() async {
  if (Platform.isAndroid) {
    final sdkInt = await _getAndroidSdkVersion();
    return sdkInt >= 29; // Android 10 is API level 29
  }
  return false;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Prefer App-Specific Storage**: Whenever possible, store files in app-specific directories which don't require special permissions:
   - `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`
   - `getTemporaryDirectory()`
   - `getExternalStorageDirectory()` (Android only)

2. **Use MediaStore for Media Files**: On Android 10+, use MediaStore API for images, videos, and audio files

3. **Storage Access Framework for User Selection**: When users need to select save locations, use the Storage Access Framework

4. **Request Minimal Permissions**: Only request the permissions you absolutely need

5. **Handle Permission Denials Gracefully**: Provide alternative workflows when permissions are denied

6. **Clear Documentation for Users**: Explain why your app needs certain permissions

7. **Test on Multiple Android Versions**: Especially test on Android 9, 10, and 11+ to ensure compatibility

## iOS Configuration

When implementing a cross-platform app, it's important to properly configure iOS as well. Here's how to set up file access and image picking permissions on iOS:

### Required iOS Info.plist Entries

For a Flutter app that accesses the camera and photo library, add these entries to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<!-- Camera permission -->
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to the camera to take photos.</string>

<!-- Microphone permission for video recording -->
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to the microphone to record videos.</string>

<!-- Permission to save photos to gallery -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs to save photos to your gallery.</string>

<!-- Permission to access the photo library -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to your photo library to select images.</string>
```

### iOS Podfile Configuration

Ensure your `ios/Podfile` has the appropriate iOS platform specified:

```ruby
# Define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '12.0'
```

After any changes to plugins or permissions, always run:
```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Files Not Visible in Gallery Apps**
   - Solution: Use MediaStore API to insert media into public collections

2. **Storage Permission Denied**
   - Solution: Provide clear explanation to users about why the permission is needed
   - Provide an app-specific storage fallback

3. **Files Disappear After App Uninstall**
   - This is expected for app-specific storage
   - Use public directories via MediaStore API for files that should persist

4. **Different Behavior Across Android Versions**
   - Use version detection as shown in our StorageService
   - Apply appropriate strategy based on the detected version

5. **Permission Dialog Not Showing on Android 6+**
   - Ensure you're calling the permission request at the right time
   - Don't request permission before user interaction

6. **MissingPluginException on iOS**
   - Make sure all required permission strings are added to Info.plist
   - Run `pod install` in the ios directory
   - Ensure the app is completely rebuilt (not just hot reloaded)
